        3: "Debra Newell is a successful interior designer. She meets John Meehan, a handsome man who seems to check all the boxes: attentive, available, just back from a year in Iraq with Doctors Without Borders. But her family doesn\342\200\231t like John, and they get entangled in an increasingly complex web of love, deception, forgiveness, denial, and ultimately, survival. Reported and hosted by Christopher Goffard from the L.A. Times."

We trust the system.\n\nChristopher Duntsch was a neurosurgeon who radiated confidence. He claimed he was the best in Dallas. If you had back pain, and had tried everything else, Dr. Duntsch could give you the spine surgery that would take your pain away.\n\nBut soon his patients started to experience complications, and the system failed to protect them. Which begs the question: who - or what - is that system meant to protect?\n\nFrom Wondery, the network behind the hit podcast Dirty John, DR. DEATH is a story about a charming surgeon, 33 patients and a spineless system. Reported and hosted by Laura Beil."

Founded by Henry Leland to produce plane engines during World War I, Lincoln became a key driver of the early automobile industry in the United States and a pioneer of the luxury car market. But when Leland\342\200\231s vision proved too ambitious for the nascent American car market, Lincoln was purchased by the Ford Motor Company.\n\nThe Ford acquisition would prove to be a game-changer for Lincoln. It provided the young company with a jolt of capital, marketing know-how, and a secret weapon: Henry Ford\342\200\231s son, Edsel Ford, who possessed an uncanny sense of style and what customers wanted. He would lead the Lincoln to build an entirely new class of automobile: something \342\200\234strictly continental.\342\200\235 Brought to you by the 2019 Lincoln MKC."

The maneuver was masterminded by hot-headed but politically savvy Henry Clay, who with Adams, announced their intent for far-reaching new federal programs. Fierce opposition to these policies united pro-Jackson supporters who formed a new party, the Democrats, to rally around their hero and elect him to president in 1828.\n\nBut while Adams was defeated, Henry Clay had no intention of leaving the fight. He helped lead a new party which gathered together anti-Jackson, fiscal conservatives, and pro-states rights factions. The rise of Clay\342\200\231s new Whig party seemed unstoppable\342\200\223they captured both houses of Congress and the presidency\342\200\223until, on April 4, 1841, president William Henry Harrison died in office and gave John Tyler the power of the veto.\n\nSupport this show by supporting our sponsors!\n\nThe Great Courses - Get unlimited access to courses on any topic at\302\240TheGreatCoursesPlus.com/Tellers\n\nLightstream - You can get an additional discount by visiting\302\240Lightstream.com/TELLERS\n\nThe Art of Shaving - Get 15% off your first order by using the code \"Tellers\" at checkout, online or in the store."

The Boston Globe\342\200\231s Spotlight Team, best known for its investigation of the sexual abuse scandal inside the Catholic Church, takes a hard look at the crisis facing football through the lens of Aaron Hernandez\342\200\231s life and terrible crimes.\n\nFrom Wondery, the podcast team that brought you Dr. Death, Spotlight asks: Did a brain badly damaged by football contribute to Hernandez\342\200\231s violent behavior? Did he keep secrets about his sexuality that collided with a hyper-masculine football culture? Did elite coaches and teams look the other way as Hernandez was spiraling out of control?\n\nSpotlight uncovered new documents, audio, and interviews to go deep into the story of what happened to Aaron Hernandez, and what it means for those of us who cheer on a violent game."

His number of victims would have almost certainly been higher had he not spent 16 of those years in prison for his first murder.\n\nJoin Mike and Gibby as they discuss Kirkland who operated just 45 minutes south of where the hosts live. Kirkland\'s MO included strangling and burning the bodies of his victims and he never varied. And even though he spent most of his life in prison, he had so many other brushes with the law where he got off easy. This is one of those cases where you have to question whether the justice system failed to protect the public from this type of vicious predator.\n\nYou can help support the show at patreon.com/truecrimeallthetime\n\nVisit the show\'s website at truecrimeallthetime.com for contact, merchandise, and donation information\n\nHelp the show by supporting our sponsors:\n\nExpressVPN - go to expressvpn.com/tcatt to get 3 months free with a 1-year package\n\nBetterHelp - go to betterhelp.com/tcatt and use the promo code tcatt to get 10% off your first month"

As Michael goes to prison for illegal activities on his lot, the investigation into his wife\'s murder goes ice cold.

        2: "Ever wonder if it\342\200\231s possible to build a flourishing career and global brand, without going to college?\n\nGrowing up in San Diego and Tampa, Rebecca Minkoff (http://www.rebeccaminkoff.com/) learned at a young age, if she wanted something, she\342\200\231d have to work for it, or make it herself. That work ethic led her to begin making her own clothes in her early teens, then designing and creating costumes for theater in high-school.\n\nDesperate to leave Tampa behind as soon as she could, but not feeling college, she headed to New York at 18 years old and began to work in the world of fashion and design, learning everything from design to all aspects of business. She began making her own designs and, working tirelessly, created a single t-shirt that would seed the launch of a business that would grow to produce an iconic line of handbags, apparel, accessories, footwear, jewelry and build a global brand.\n\nAnd, more recently, she\342\200\231s headed into entirely new territory with the launch of her own podcast, Superwomen (https://www.rebeccaminkoff.com/pages/superwomen) which celebrates the multidimensionality of women, from CEOs to chefs, entrepreneurs to instructors who shape culture, change the world, and lift each other up along the way.\n\nWe talk about all of this and much more in today\342\200\231s Good Life Project episode.\n\nCheck out our offerings & partners:\302\240\n\n  * 23andMe: Order your 23andMe Health + Ancestry Service kit at 23andme.com/goodlife\n  * Quip:\302\240QUIP starts at just $25 and, if you go to GetQuip.com/GoodLife right now, you\342\200\231ll get your first refill pack FREE with a QUIP electric toothbrush.\n  * Kneipp: Get 15% off your first order by going to Kneipp.com and use promo code GOODLIFE at checkout."

Quickly, the investigation grows out of their control, as they discover that, not only are the legends seemingly true, many people in Blackwood have turned up dead or disappeared without a trace. Worse, there may be a reason why no one has ever uncovered the truth before. Someone is watching them, willing to do whatever it takes to keep the secret. Their recordings have finally been released."

        2: "August 20, 1989. Beverly Hills, California. Jose and Kitty Menendez were eating ice cream and watching a movie at home when they were shot to death. Their two sons, Lyle (21) and Erik (18) said that they were not home at the time but their behavior following the murders of their parents as well as the investigation into it began to reveal a different story. The two sons had burned through a lot of money buying cars, trips and even a restaurant. After Erik told his psychiatrist, Dr. Jerome Oziel, that he and his brother had killed their parents, Oziel\'s mistress then told police. Investigators then knew who committed the murders but not why. When the case went to trial, Erik\'s defense attorney, Leslie Abramson, alleged that Lyle and Erik had endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of their father. It was said that they feared that they would be killed and that was why they shot their parents. Were the murders done out of fear? Or did Lyle and Erik just want their parents\' money?"

Then, in 2013, Roger and Mary Brumback, both 65, were murdered and the similarities between the two led the police to Anthony Garcia, a former employee of Roger Brumback and Thomas\342\200\231 father, William Hunter, who appeared to have a grudge against those who fired him from Creighton University Medical Center. But with very little evidence found at the crime scenes, how could it be proven that Garcia committed the crimes?"

        2: "April 26, 2005. Durham, North Carolina. 30 year old Raven Abaroa returns home after a soccer game to find his wife slumped over on the floor in their home. At first he was not alarmed as she would often do this when she had cramps. But when he got close to her, he could see that his wife, 25 year old Janet Abaroa, was covered in blood and appeared to be deceased. The couple\'s 6 month old son was found unharmed in his room. Investigators did not suspect that robbery was a motive in the crime so they began to look at the people in her life. It took nearly five years for authorities to arrest their suspect: Raven Abaroa. The investigation had turned up a number of troubling red flags about him, but would they have enough evidence to bring Janet\'s killer to justice? Raven claimed to have an alibi for the time of the murder and said that he had witnesses to prove it."
